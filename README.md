# Purchase Analysis and Prediction Based on Demographics

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer purchasing behavior based on demographic factors such as **salary**, **gender**, and **age**. By leveraging machine learning models, it predicts purchasing decisions in real time. The results of these predictions are presented in an interactive web application, allowing users to input demographic data and receive predictions instantly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions:** Users can input their age, salary, and gender to predict whether they are likely to make a purchase.
    
- **Web Application Interface:** The project is deployed as a web app for easy access and interaction.
    
- **Data Analysis:** Preprocessing and feature engineering on customer data are done to create a reliable prediction model.
    
- **Machine Learning Model:** A prediction model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, etc.) is used to predict customer behavior. KNN gave the best results.
